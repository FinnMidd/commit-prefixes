## Settings ⚙️

-  **Label Style**: Select whether you want to your emojis to appear alongside your prefix labels, so that you can easily tell which is which *(on by default).*

-  **Append Emojis**: When turned on, this feature will automatically add the prefix's associated emoji to the end of your commit message *(on by default).*

## Customization 🎨

This extension can easily fit your own workflow! You can fully customize the list of commit prefixes to match your team's style or your own personal preferences. Here's how:

1.  **Open Your User Settings**: Open the `settings.json` file in your editor. This is where you can add or modify your own commit prefixes.

2.  **Locate Prefix Structure**: Once inside the file, look for the `myExtension.commitMessagePrefixes` array. This is the array that stores all of the existing commit prefixes.

3.  **Edit Your Prefix Array**: Each item in the array represents one of your prefix options. Edit or add items to customize these prefixes to your own liking. Each item uses the following structure:

```json
{
	"label": "Feature",
	"prefix": "Feat:",
	"emoji": "🎉",
	"main": true,
	"active": true
},
```

- List of properties:
	- "label": The display name of the prefix.
	- "prefix": The text that will appear at the start of your commit message.
	- "emoji": An emoji that represents the prefix.
	- "main": Determines whether the item appears in the initial quick pick, or requires a search.
	- "active": Determines the prefix's availability.



4.  **Save Your File**: Once all your changes are complete, save the `settings.json` file, and all the updated prefixes will automatically flow through into the extension's command.

That's it! Now you’re all ready to commit with your own custom prefixes and emojis! 🎉
