# Speed up Your Commit Prefixes! ðŸ”¥

This extension allows you to improve your Git commit workflow by effortlessly adding customizable prefixes & optional emojis to your commit messages, with the press of a button. It's all about making your Git workflow faster, easier, and a whole lot more fun.

## Features

-  **Quickly Pick Your Prefix**: Use the `edit` icon in the Source Control View or the  `Ctrl + Shift + =` shortcut, to quickly select from your list of predefined prefixes and automatically insert them into your commit message.

-  **Automatic Emoji Support**: An optional feature to automatically add the associated emoji into your commit message, appending it at end of your commit messages. âœ¨

-  **Personal Customization**: Easily edit & add your own set of prefixes, labels, and associated emojis, to cater to your workplace & preferred standardization.

-  **Automatic Prefix Replacement**: Accidentally selected the wrong prefix? Quickly replace it by running the command again & selecting your preferred prefix.

## Settings

-  **Label Style**: Select whether you want to your emojis to appear alongside your prefix labels, so that you can easily tell which is which *(on by default).*

-  **Append Emojis**: When turned on, this feature will automatically add the prefix's associated emoji to the end of your commit message *(off by default).*

-  **Hotkey**: By default, the key binding for this extension is set to `Ctrl + Shift + =` however, this can be altered in VSCode's Keyboard Shortcuts page, by searching for the `Fill Commit Message` command *(on by default).*

## Customization

This extension can easily fit your own workflow! You can fully customize the list of commit prefixes to match your team's style or your own personal preferences. Here's how:

1.  **Open Your User Settings**: Open the `settings.json` file in your editor. This is where you can add or modify your own commit prefixes.

2.  **Locate Prefix Structure**: Once inside the file, look for the `myExtension.commitMessagePrefixes` array. This is the array that stores all of the existing commit prefixes.

3.  **Edit Your Prefix Array**: Each item in the array represents one of your prefix options. Edit or add items to customize these prefixes to your own liking. Each item uses the following structure:

```json
{
	"label": "Feature",
	"prefix": "Feature:",
	"emoji": "âœ¨",
	"main": true,
	"active": true
},
// Add additional prefixes here...
```

	   "label": The display name of the prefix.
	   "prefix": The text that will appear at the start of your commit message.
	   "emoji": The emoji that represents the prefix.
	   "main": Determines whether the item appears in the initial quick pick, or requires a search.
	   "active": Determines the prefix availability (`false` turns it off).

4.  **Save Your File**: Once all your changes are complete, save the `settings.json` file, and all the updated prefixes will automatically flow through into the extension's command.

That's it! Now youâ€™re all ready to commit with your own custom prefixes and emojis! ðŸŽ‰
